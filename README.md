## **Project Objective:**
The objective of the project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of student internships to gain insights into the relationship between their academic performance, event participation, career aspirations, and factors influencing their success. The project aims to utilize data analysis techniques to extract meaningful patterns and correlations, enabling better decision-making for both students and recruiters in the job market.
<br><br>
## **Business Case:**
The project is justified by the need to address the high rejection rate of resumes in the initial screening process. With millions of students applying for internships/jobs each year, there is intense competition, and a well-prepared resume is essential for making a positive first impression. By analyzing student attributes and performance, the project aims to identify key success factors that can enhance students' chances of securing internships and jobs. This, in turn, benefits both the students by increasing their employability and the recruiters by streamlining the hiring process and finding more suitable candidates.
<br><br>
## **Project Goal:**
The project goal is to achieve a comprehensive analysis of the dataset within a specified timeline while efficiently utilizing available resources. The performance goal is to identify relevant insights and patterns in student data, helping to improve the overall understanding of factors that contribute to internship and job success. The time goal is to complete the analysis and present the findings within a defined timeframe. The resource goal is to efficiently utilize data analytics tools, expertise, and personnel to ensure a successful project outcome.

## **Expected Deliverables:**
<br>
-Detailed Analysis Report: A comprehensive report presenting the findings of the analysis, including insights into the relationship between academic performance, event participation, career aspirations, and success in internships/jobs.<br>
-Data Visualization: Clear and informative visualizations that illustrate key trends and correlations in the dataset, aiding in the understanding of the results.<br>
-Key Success Factors: A list of identified success factors that significantly influence student internship and job prospects, providing valuable guidance to students and recruiters.<br>
-Recommendations: Actionable recommendations based on the analysis to help students improve their resumes and increase their chances of success in the job market.<br>
-Business Case Document: A documented justification for the project, outlining the benefits, costs, and risks associated with the analysis, providing stakeholders with a rationale for the preferred solution.

## **Project Scope:**

-Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and preprocess the dataset containing various attributes for each student, ensuring data integrity and quality.

-Descriptive Analysis: Conduct descriptive statistical analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of student attributes like GPA, event participation, career aspirations, Python programming experience, and family income.

-GPA Variation Among Colleges: Analyze the variation in GPA among different colleges and present the top 5 colleges with the highest average GPAs.

-Student Experience with Python: Examine the distribution of students' experience with Python programming and determine the percentage of students with Python skills.

-Family Income Analysis: Calculate the average family income of the students and identify its relationship with academic performance and career aspirations.

-Event Participation and Success Correlation: Investigate the connection between students' event participation and their success in securing internships/jobs.

-Outliers in Courses Completed: Identify outliers in the quantity attribute (number of courses completed) to understand any potential patterns or anomalies.

## **Out of Scope (Planned for Future Development Stages):**

-Predictive Analysis: Building predictive models to forecast student success in internships/jobs based on various attributes. This may include machine learning algorithms for classification or regression tasks.

-Deep Dive into Career Aspirations: Conducting in-depth analysis of students' career aspirations and their alignment with different industries or job roles.

-Longitudinal Analysis: Analyzing data over multiple years to track student performance and success trends over time.

-Text Analysis of Resumes: Employing natural language processing techniques to analyze the content of resumes and extract valuable information.

-External Data Integration: Incorporating external data sources, such as industry trends or job market reports, to provide additional context for the analysis.

-User Interface Development: Creating a user-friendly interface to visualize and interact with the analysis results for students and recruiters.

-Recommendation Engine: Developing a recommendation engine to suggest tailored improvement strategies for students based on their individual attributes and goals.
